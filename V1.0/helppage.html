    <p class="indented">
        The Bitcoin Association supports Bitcoin SV (BSV) as the original Bitcoin. 
        Reflecting its mission to fulfil the <em>“Satoshi Vision”</em>, BSV was created to restore the original Satoshi protocol,
        keep it stable and enable it to massively scale.
        Unlike other Bitcoin projects, only Bitcoin SV has the plan for a stable protocol and plan for massive on-chain scaling to become the world’s new money and the global public blockchain for enterprise. 
        This is critical to ignite the future of bCommerce and create a profitable ecosystem for all Bitcoin industry participants.
